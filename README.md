# 100-Day-of-coding-python
My journey of learning and revisiting topics about coding.

## Day one
On the first day, the main task was to create a Band Name Generator for a band that is unable to come up with the a name. The sample provided worked as stated below:
- The program asked The city the user grew in.
- The program as well asked about the user's pet's name.

From that the program gave a sample name for the user.

### Lessons Learnt.

I learnt about the print function. The print function takes input and displays it to the user. The princt function take input of certain input like **strings**. Strings are basically a collection of characters. I got some insight into syntax highlighting on code editors.
- Print function.
- Input function.
- Strings.
- Variable.
- Naming.
